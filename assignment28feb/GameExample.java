//    Multi-threading can be very useful in a car racing game because there are multiple processes that need to run simultaneously in order to create a realistic and immersive experience. Let's look at a few examples of how multi-threading can be used in a car racing game:
//
//    Physics simulation: One of the most important aspects of a car racing game is the physics simulation, which determines
//    how the cars interact with the environment and with each other. By running the physics simulation on a separate thread,
//    the game can calculate collisions, momentum, and other physical properties in real-time, allowing the cars to move and
//    react in a more realistic way.
//
//    Graphics rendering: The graphics rendering process is responsible for creating the visual display of the game,
//    including the cars, the track, and the environment. By running the graphics rendering process on a separate thread,
//    the game can display high-quality graphics at a high frame rate, even when there are many cars on the track.
//
//    Audio playback: In a car racing game, the sound effects and music are an important part of the overall experience.
//    By running the audio playback process on a separate thread, the game can generate realistic sound effects and
//    play music without slowing down other processes.
//
//    Game logic: The game logic process handles the rules of the game, such as the scoring system, the AI opponents,
//    and the various power-ups and obstacles. By running the game logic process on a separate thread, the game can calculate
//    these rules in real-time, allowing for a more engaging and immersive experience.
//
//    In summary, multi-threading can be very useful in a car racing game because it allows multiple processes to run simultaneously,
//    improving performance and creating a more realistic and immersive experience for the player. By separating processes
//    like physics simulation, graphics rendering, audio playback, and game logic onto different threads, the game can run
//    more smoothly and deliver a better user experience.
